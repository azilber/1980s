E-MAN
=======

The game that never was.  I was writing this in late 1989-1990's and aiming to eventually sell it as shareware
focused on the more adult BBS crowd.  Then the internet happened, and this didn't.  Enjoy the code!

The executable in here should world with the provided DOOR.SYS with the /LOCAL switch.  Game mechanics
wasn't in yet, but humor was.

```
    The object of the game is to become the supreme Psychotron.
Nothing must stand in your way as you kill and mutilate your
way to the top.  Buy weapons and armor to slaughter your foes.
The Psychotron is the ultimate in Artificial Intelligence and
combat Soldier.................................................
    After the Great Fall humanity was plunged into
a Dark Age from which there was no hope.  But humanity survived!
Humans destroyed the mechanical menaces that plagued them but,
in the process, became machines themselves....The Psychotrons.
   While some remained sane others went on psychotic killing
sprees.  This was the second Dark Age.  But you call it
...........................HOME............................
